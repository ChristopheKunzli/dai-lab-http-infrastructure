# HTTP - infrastructure

## Step 0: Github & Readme

The notes for each step will be in this markdown file.

### Setting up git

To import our project, you can do the command:

```code
git clone https://github.com/ChristopheKunzli/dai-lab-http-infrastructure.git
```

## Step 1: Static Web site

First, created and named the folder **static-web-server**, a folder which will contain the static web server. We then
created a Dockerfile in the root of **static-web-server**, and imported the image of ``` nginx:alpine ```

In the nginx.conf file, we set our server name as ```localhost```, listening on port 80, and default location and index
name. This location is of the virtual space that is created when starting docker, and that is used in the Dockerfile
with lines such as ```COPY ./html /usr/share/nginx/html```. This line copies the html folder in the virtual space.

To run the image, we first use, while in the **static-web-server** folder, the command:

```code
docker build -t static-web-server .
```

This command is used to create the docker image sous le nom de **static-web-server**. To start it, we can use:

```code
docker run -d -p 80:80 static-web-server
```

with ```-d``` meaning ```detach```, to run in the background, and ```-p``` means that we specify the port (in our case,
80)

## Step 2: Docker compose

At the root of this repository, we have created a **docker-compose.yml** file.

```yaml
services:
  static-web-server:
    build:
      context: ./static-web-server
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Build with the command:

```code
docker-compose build
```

Run with:

```code
docker-compose up -d
```
At this point, we can open a browser and search ```localhost:80```. You should see the web site.

Stop with:

```code
docker-compose down
```

## Step 3: HTTP API server

## Step 4: Reverse proxy with Traefik

## Step 5: Scalability and load balancing

## Step 6: Load balancing with round-robin and sticky sessions

## Step 7: Securing Traefik with HTTPS
