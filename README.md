# HTTP - infrastructure

## Step 0: Github & Readme
The notes for each step will be in this markdown file.  

### Setting up git
To import our project, you can do the command:  
```code
git clone https://github.com/ChristopheKunzli/dai-lab-http-infrastructure.git
```

## Step 1: Static Web site
First, created and named the folder **static-web-server**, a folder which will contain the static web server. We then created a Dockerfile in the root of **static-web-server**, and imported the image of ``` nginx:alpine ```  

In the nginx.conf file, we set our server name as ```localhost```, listening on port 80, and default location and index name. This location is of the virtual space that is created when starting docker, and that is used in the Dockerfile with lines such as ```COPY ./html /usr/share/nginx/html```. This line copies the html folder in the virtual space.

To run the image, we first use, while in the **static-web-server** folder, the command:  
```code
docker build -t static-web-server .
```

This command is used to create the docker image sous le nom de **static-web-server**. To start it, we can use:  
```code
docker run -d -p 80:80 static-web-server
```

with ```-d``` meaning ```detach```, to run in the background, and ```-p``` means that we specify the port (in our case, 80)

## Step 2: Docker compose

## Step 3: HTTP API server

## Step 4: Reverse proxy with Traefik

## Step 5: Scalability and load balancing

## Step 6: Load balancing with round-robin and sticky sessions

## Step 7: Securing Traefik with HTTPS
